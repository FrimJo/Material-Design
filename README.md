# Material Design
After watching the Google OI at the end of May 2014 I got realy excited about <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a>. So I jumped streight in and started reading the documentation for this new UX design pattern.

I then set up <a href="http://130.239.115.172/user176/material_design/">this page</a>, which in time will be my nav for my project, call it a portfolio.

It's still far from finished and I still need to work on responsivity, buggs and cross browser suport, atm. it works best on Google Chrome. I also want to transfer it over to node.js and a MVC setup in the future.

I have mostly been working on the animations, and thanks to <a href="https://greensock.com">GreenSock</a> it's been reely enjoyable.
