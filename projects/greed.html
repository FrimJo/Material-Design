	<h5>About</h5>
	<p>This is a school project in which I made a nice application for playing a game of dice called Greed (also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle" target="_blank">Farkle</a>)</p>
	<p>This is a dice game where you play by your self or with one or more players and take turns rolling six dices. You get points for three of a kind and straights, and also for each one and five which isn't part of any other combination. For each roll which grants a sum of points which is more or equal to 300 you get the choice of either try get more points and risk losing all the points you gathered this turn or stay save and pass the turn to the next player, hence the name Greed. The first player to reach 10.000 points wins the game.</p>
	
	<h5>Limitations</h5>
	<p>I hade some limitations to the application, one of them being that I had to suport APK so old as of APK 15 so I would liked to have som more material design look and feel.</p>

	<h5>MVC and TDD</h5>
	<p>What I like the most about this project is not how well it looks, feels and how pleasing it is to play but how well I implemented the MVC pattern and how I from scratch developed the models using a test driven approach. It felt really fun and refreshing.</p>
