	<h5>About</h5>
	<p>This is a room booking application which is the result of the course Design Build Test. In this course we made this application as a real life project, working towards a real company having real specification and a real product to deliver.</p>
	<p>When I contacted <a href="http://dohi.se/" target="_blank">Dohi</a> at the early stages of the course they already had a project id√© they wanted us to implement. They hade recently moved into a new office and hade a bunch of group rooms which the employees could book for meetings etc. At the time of the meeting with Dohi they used Office 365 for the booking but would love to have som kind of way to easily se from afar if a specific room is available and also after approach be able to book the room. Each room would have it's own screen displaying the current status of the room as well as upcoming status.</p>

	<h5>The work</h5>
	<p>Since Dohi uses the Office 365 work suite and environment we didn't have much choice but to use Microsoft Visual Studio and C#, we took the opportunity to harness our skills in the MVC pattern by develop using MVC5.</p>
	<p>The group consisted of six people, we started of thinking about how we are supost to realize this project. None of the group members hade earlier used Microsofts Azure nor Azure AD User Management, so a lot of time were put in research and trying to incorporate the Microsoft calendar API while simultaneous thinking of how we would present the data in a way that meets the above criteria.</p>
	<p>After some time of research and test-projects we were ready to implement. We worked as parallel as possible by implementing the views while implementing the models for the api communication. And at the end of the course we made it, everything came out nice and all were satisfied.</p>
	
	<h5>My part</h5>
	<p>I took most part in the back-end programing department but all members in the group were involved in both UX design, front-end development as well as back-end development. We had five group members working on the design, divided in three groups we used close analysis intervals where we all gathered and did some testing of the design on each other and discussed colors, layout and functionality.</p>
	<p>When we nailed the design I continued with the back-end programing and one of the other five members transcended in to front-end programer, the two of us worked rely closely together and helped each other out allot.</p>
